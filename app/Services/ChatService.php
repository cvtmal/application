Date of Birth: 19/11/1986
Location: Uster
Family: Married, 2 daughters (5 and 1 year old)
Interests: Web development, coffee, DJing, skateboarding, gaming, motorcycling, snowboarding, sometimes skiing, 20 years of karate but not active anymore.

I originally studied law for four years at the University of Zurich (2008–2012) and then pursued business law at ZHAW for two years (2012–2014). During my studies, I worked part-time as an IT recruiter (2012–2015) and eventually dropped out to start my own business.

In 2015/2016, I founded myitjob, where I initially managed the development of a recruiting software (Applicant Tracking System & CRM) created by a Swiss software company. Since then, I have taught myself programming—first through books, then through online courses (especially Laracasts). My interest in software development and IT started back in 2012, and since 2016 I have been working extensively with Laravel (since version 5.4), PHP, and MySQL/MariaDB.

From 2018 onwards, I began developing our software independently, and since 2020 I have been managing the entire development process on my own—from backend development with Laravel, building APIs and integrations, all the way to frontend implementation. In doing so, I have gained solid knowledge in HTML, CSS (including Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript.

I have only used Vue.js in smaller projects so far and would describe my skills there as basic. However, I have gained more experience with React combined with Inertia.js.
When it comes to build tools, I have experience with Webpack, though recently I’ve been using Vite more often due to its superior developer experience.

Additionally, I develop external microservices, such as PDF generators or PDF parsers using local LLMs. Currently, I am also working on a Flutter/Dart app on the side, for which I provide the API using Laravel and Sanctum.

Alongside my own projects, I also support two online shops as a freelancer (kollegg.ch, WordPress and kindundwetter.ch, Shopify).

Even after 12 years, I still enjoy my primary job as an IT recruiter, especially because of the contact with so many interesting IT professionals. However, if I had to choose one profession for the rest of my life, it would definitely be software development. I love turning my own ideas into web applications, thinking through architectures, refactoring solutions, and building clean, sustainable systems.

My clear focus is on modern web development, with a strong commitment to code quality and developer experience—and I especially enjoy working on projects with Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Tailwind, and the entire ecosystem that comes with it. My favorite IDE is PhpStorm. I love to attend Laravel conferences and meetups, only online so far, but I am always eager to learn new things and I'll plan to attend a Laravel Switzerland Meetup in person in the near future.
